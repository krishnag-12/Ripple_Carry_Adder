# 2-bit Ripple_Carry_Adder
# Purpose:

Implements a 2-bit ripple-carry adder, which performs addition on two 2-bit binary numbers.
#Functionality:

Takes two 2-bit input values (a and b) and a carry-in bit (cin).
Performs addition using two full-adder (FA) modules.
The first FA (FA0) adds the least significant bits of a and b along with the carry-in, producing the least significant bit of the sum and an intermediate carry (c1).
The second FA (FA1) adds the most significant bits of a and b along with the intermediate carry (c1), producing the most significant bit of the sum and the final carry-out (c_out).
# Code Breakdown:

Module Declaration:
Defines the module name ripple_carry_adder.
Specifies the input ports:
a[1:0]: 2-bit input number A.
b[1:0]: 2-bit input number B.
cin: Carry-in input.
Specifies the output ports:
sum[1:0]: 2-bit sum output.
c_out: Carry-out output.
# Wire Declaration:
Declares a wire c1 to store the intermediate carry.
# Full-Adder Instantiation:
Instantiates two full-adder modules (FA0 and FA1).
Connects the appropriate input and output ports of each FA module according to their functionality.
# Key Points:

The code effectively demonstrates the use of full-adder modules to construct a ripple-carry adder.
The intermediate carry wire c1 is essential for propagating the carry from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments.
# Additional Considerations:

For larger bit widths, more full-adder modules would be needed, and the carry propagation would be more complex.
Other adder architectures, such as carry-lookahead adders, can provide faster performance for larger bit widths.
